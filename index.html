            <li style="padding: 0.5em">
              <strong>1862:</strong> Hilma af Klint is born on October 26 at
              Karlbergs slott in Stockholm. She is the fourth of five children.
            </li>
            <li style="padding: 0.5em">
              <strong>1880:</strong> Hilma af Klint attends the Tekniska skolan
              (Technical School) and classes in portrait painting. Her sister
              Hermina dies and the loss spurs on Hilma af Klint’s interest in
              religion and spiritualism.
            </li>
            <li style="padding: 0.5em">
              <strong>1882-87:</strong> She attends the Royal Academy of Fine
              Arts and graduates with honors from the Academy.
            </li>
            <li style="padding: 0.5em">
              <strong>18896:</strong> Hilma af Klint regularly attends spiritual
              meetings with four female friends. The group call themselves “The
              Five”. During their séances, they make contact with so called
              “high masters”. The Five begin to document their experiences in
              notebooks. The group also practices automatic writing and drawing,
              which means writing and drawing without consciously guiding the
              movement of the pen on the paper.
            </li>
            <li style="padding: 0.5em">
              <strong>1904:</strong> During a séance, she is told that she will
              be commissioned to make paintings on the astral plane. Her works
              are to represent the immortal aspects of man.
            </li>
            <li style="padding: 0.5em">
              <strong>1906:</strong> She starts working on The Paintings for the
              Temple, which will comprise several different series and groups of
              paintings on various themes.
            </li>
            <li style="padding: 0.5em">
              <strong>1911:</strong> Hilma af Klint’s early naturalist paintings
              are exhibited by the Föreningen Svenska Konstnärinnor (Association
              of Swedish Women Artists) at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts in
              Stockholm.
            </li>
            <li style="padding: 0.5em">
              <strong>1912-15:</strong> Several new series and groups are
              painted under the influence of spirits, but her work is
              significantly more independent than it had been previously. These
              works include The Swan and The Dove groups.
            </li>
            <li style="padding: 0.5em">
              <strong>1917:</strong> She paints the geometrically abstract Atom
              series, in which her strong interest in the natural sciences is
              palpable. Hilma af Klint also dictates her thoughts on spiritual.
              When the text is transcribed, it comprises 1,240 typewritten
              pages.
            </li>
            <li style="padding: 0.5em">
              <strong>1920:</strong> Her mother dies. An intensely creative year
              begins. Hilma af Klint moves to Helsingborg with Thomasine
              Andersson, who had been her mother’s nurse. She joins the
              Anthroposophical Society.
            </li>
            <li style="padding: 0.5em">
              <strong>1944:</strong> Leaves her artistic estate, comprising more
              than 1,000 works and just over 125 notebooks, to her nephew, Erik
              af Klint. Hilma af Klint does not want it to be shown until at
              least twenty years after her death.
